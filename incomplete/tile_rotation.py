    # If the number of 90 degree rotations is odd, the variable that was 
    # originally on the 'U' points will be situated on the 'V' points and 
    # vice versa because the meaning of x and y will be swapped.  The 
    # rotated version of U will come from V and vice versa.  
    # On the other hand, if the 
    # number of 90 degree rotations is even the rotated version of U comes 
    # from U and vice versa.

    # If the variables involve velocity or fluxes, the variables may need
    # to change sign after rotation.

    # in tiles 8-13 in the original llc tile layout.

    # +U velocities in the +x direction of tiles 8-13 become -V velocties
